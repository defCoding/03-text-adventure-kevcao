# "A Locked House"
A fictional text adventure game. I created a locked house type of scenario where the player is trapped in a house. All rooms are linked together using a JSON file, and some events require certain items from other rooms. For example, a key will be needed for the player to leave the house, which is the end goal of the game. 


At each room, the player is given options available to him, and the player can choose from there what to do next. Based on what is in the player's inventory, certain deciions will succeed. At the end of the game, the player is given the total number of moves it took to beat the game.
